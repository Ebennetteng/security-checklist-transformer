# Security Checklist Transformer

Utility application for taking the absolutely awesome Security checklists from [Sqreen](https://www.sqreen.com/),
converting the HTML into markdown and uploading them into your ticketing system.

Checklists Supported:
 - [SaaS CTO Security Checklist](https://www.sqreen.com/checklists/saas-cto-security-checklist)
 - [The Early Security Engineerâ€™s First 90 Days Checklist](https://www.sqreen.com/checklists/security-engineer-checklist)

Others can be easily added as the HTML document structure for each of these checklists are pretty much the same.

## Why

When establishing a security plan for your company, you and your management will probably want to establish
both short and long term goals for your security team.

You may want to capture these "User Stories" in your companies tracking system.
The purpose of this tool is to simplify the import of these checklist items into your ticketing system
along with wiring each issue to the appropriate project board and adding the appropriate labels.

## What does it look like?

Currently this uploader only works for GitHub (the use case I needed to support) but others could easily be added.

## How do I use this project?

### Building

To build the application, checkout the repository and run:
```bash
./gradlew install
```

You can then execute the application from the root directory of this project with the following commands: 
```bash
./subprojects/security-checklist-application/build/install/security-checklist-application/bin/security-checklist-application -h
```

This will display the configuration options for how the various labels will be pre-processed before upload.
I've made the defaults the way that I wanted them, and most of the defaults will probably be fine for you as well.
Running without a `COMMAND` will allow you to preview what the uploaded content will somewhat look like before upload.

I also recommend running this against a throw-away repository before import into your production system.
